## Important

The Student Affairs Office will *try* to remind you before your visa expires, however, the main responsibility is on you. So you better set a reminder in your calendar one month and a half before to avoid a hefty fine. The same applies for the registration, track your registration and provide the documents 7 days prior to the expiry date

In case you will need to make traslation, passport translation and notarization can be found here at +7 953 496 7777 (Whatsapp), the fee will be based on your country of origin.

Good Luck :slightly_smiling_face:
