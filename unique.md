## Money Exchange

**Currency**: The Official currency of Russia is called the Russian ruble(RUB). This acts as monetary value for diverse transactions which may occur within the Russian Federation.

1. **What to Exchange**:

As foreigners plan to travel to Russia from their respective locations, the question of which currency is best to travel with arises. Acceptable known currencies are USD(United States Dollars) and EUR(euro). You will be able to change these foreign currencies into Ruble at banks within Russia. To avoid any form of controversy, ensure the foreign banknotes are new and neat, with no form of blemish or tear, as most banks will not accept such a note.

2. **Where to Exchange**:

When changing your money it into Russian Rubles, take note of the following:

- Do not exchange money at the airport except in an emergency. The exchange rate at the airports are much higher. If you have an urgent need for some RUB, change just enough for your needs.
- The best place to carry out money exchange is in a bank. The bank rates are usually closely matched to that of the Central bank, making it the best exchange value . The Central bank's official exchange rates can be checked [here](http://www.cbr.ru/eng/currency_base/daily/) for personal reference.
- Only exchange money at the bank to ensure that the rubles you recieve is real complications.
