## Money Exchange

**Currency**: The Official currency of Russia is called the Russian ruble(RUB). This acts as monetary value for diverse transactions which may occur within the Russian Federation.

1. **What to Exchange**:

As foreigners plan to travel to Russia from their respective locations, the question of which currency is best to travel with arises. Acceptable known currencies are USD(United States Dollars) and EUR(euro). You will be able to change these foreign currencies into Ruble at banks within Russia. In order to avoid any form of controversy, ensure the foreign banknotes are new and neat, with no form of blemish or tear, as most banks will not accept such a note.

2. **Where to Exchange**:

You have the cash, and now want to change it into Russian Rubles, take note of the following:

- Do not exchange money at the airport except in an emergency. It seems easy, quick and convenient, since upon arrival into Russia, the first location is the airport. Regardless, the rates at which the airports change are much higher than the official rates. If you have urgent need of some RUB, ensure you change only a small amount adequate to your pressing needs.
- The best place to carry out money exchange is in a bank. The bank rates are usually closely matched to that of the Central bank, making it the best exchange value at which money can be changed. The Central bank's official exchange rates can be checked [here](http://www.cbr.ru/eng/currency_base/daily/) for personal reference.
- Do not change money with any random person. There are people who would like to prey on the naivety of foreigners. A better rate may be offered or other tempting lures. Please avoid using these means as it could lead to exchanging real currencies for fake, which could lead to further complications.

## Getting a SIM card

For everyday communications, a SIM card will be needed. Upon arrival at the airport, you will be able to get a SIM since there are nearby vendors within the airport. Buying at the airport is more expensive just as buying anything at the airport is usually overpriced. Getting a new SIM is relatively cheaper upon arrival to Innopolis. Some good known vendors are listed below:
