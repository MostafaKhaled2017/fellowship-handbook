## Weather

Russia is not cold all year long, from March to May in spring and the temperature is normally from +5 to +25 in late May, June to August is summer. Summer in Russia can be unpredictable, but usually, the weather is pretty nice and warm with temperatures around +15 to +30(max) degrees. From September to November is autumn. Usually, in early September the weather is like in summer, when it gets colder. At the end of September, there is usually a week of very warm weather, in Russia, it's called "babie leto" which means "granny's summer". Starting from late September temperature gets lower to +15 or even +5. Late November can be considered winter. In the winter the temperature can drop to -25 degrees, so you have to take warm clothes with you or buy them here.
